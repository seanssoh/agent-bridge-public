# Operations

This is the operator runbook for a normal Agent Bridge install.

The recommended layout is:

- Source checkout: `~/.agent-bridge-source`
- Live runtime: `~/.agent-bridge`

The source checkout is safe to pull from GitHub. The live runtime contains local
state, logs, queues, agent homes, and machine-specific configuration. Do not
replace it with a raw `cp -R` or `git clone`.

## Daily Startup

Verify prerequisites:

```bash
git --version
python3 --version
tmux -V
claude --version
```

On macOS, use Homebrew Bash when available because the system Bash is too old
for associative arrays:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/bash --version
```

Start or verify the daemon:

```bash
~/.agent-bridge/agent-bridge daemon ensure
~/.agent-bridge/agent-bridge daemon status
```

If the shell integration is installed, the shorthand is:

```bash
agb daemon ensure
agb daemon status
```

On macOS, keep the daemon under `launchd` so crashes auto-restart:

```bash
cd ~/.agent-bridge
./scripts/install-daemon-launchagent.sh --apply --load
launchctl print gui/$UID/ai.agent-bridge.daemon
```

`agb bootstrap` also installs a sibling LaunchAgent / systemd timer
(`ai.agent-bridge.daemon-liveness` on macOS,
`agent-bridge-daemon-liveness.timer` on Linux) that watches
`state/daemon.heartbeat`. KeepAlive only catches process death; the
liveness watcher catches the silent-hang case (issue #265) where the
daemon process is alive but its main loop has frozen. It restarts the
daemon when the heartbeat mtime exceeds
`BRIDGE_DAEMON_LIVENESS_THRESHOLD_SECONDS` (default 600s) and honours
`BRIDGE_DAEMON_LIVENESS_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` (default 600s) to avoid
restart loops on a broken daemon. Pass `--skip-liveness` to `bootstrap`
to opt out, or invoke the installer directly:

```bash
./scripts/install-daemon-liveness-launchagent.sh --apply --load    # macOS
./scripts/install-daemon-liveness-systemd.sh --apply --enable      # Linux
```

Check overall status:

```bash
agb status
agb list
```

If the daemon misbehaves, inspect live runtime logs:

```bash
tail -n 80 ~/.agent-bridge/state/daemon.log
tail -n 80 ~/.agent-bridge/state/daemon-crash.log
tail -n 80 ~/.agent-bridge/state/launchagent.log
tail -n 80 ~/.agent-bridge/state/launchagent-liveness.log     # macOS liveness watcher
tail -n 80 ~/.agent-bridge/state/systemd-daemon-liveness.log  # Linux liveness watcher
```

On launchd-managed macOS installs the daemon writes its stdout/stderr to
`state/launchagent.log` (the `StandardOut/ErrorPath` redirect target of the
`ai.agent-bridge.daemon` plist), so `state/daemon.log` freezes at the moment
launchd takes over. On installs where `state/launchagent.config` exists
(written by `scripts/install-daemon-launchagent.sh --apply` from this
version forward), `BRIDGE_DAEMON_LOG` defaults to the configured launchagent
log path recorded in that marker — including custom `--label`/`--plist`/
`--log-path` installs. Operators on Linux (systemd/nohup) installs, and on
pre-marker macOS installs that have not yet rerun `--apply`, keep
`state/daemon.log` as the SSOT. Setting `BRIDGE_DAEMON_LOG` in env always
wins. Operators on pre-v0.7.X installs can either rerun `--apply` once or
set `BRIDGE_DAEMON_LOG` in their environment.
`agb daemon status` prints both `log=` and `launchagent_log=` lines when
the operator's `BRIDGE_DAEMON_LOG` resolves to a file other than the
configured launchagent log, so you can confirm where output is landing
without guessing.

## Upgrade

표준 upgrade 절차는 [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md) 에 정리되어 있다. 모든 install 에서 동일한 명령으로 진행한다:

```bash
agb upgrade --dry-run
agb upgrade --apply
```

`--apply` 는 atomic — daemon stop/start, agent restart, shared settings rerender (managed default `autoCompactWindow=1_000_000` propagate; 자세한 내용은 [autoCompactWindow default](#autocompactwindow-default-v076-issue-570) 참고), shared hooks 재등록, `_template/CLAUDE.md` sync, `[upgrade-complete]` admin task 등록 모두 포함.

The upgrader preserves local runtime data by default:

- `agent-roster.local.sh`
- `state/`
- `logs/`
- `shared/`
- `agents/*` runtime homes
- local backups and generated files

매 release 의 후속 행동 (operator action) 은 [`OPERATOR_ACTIONS_PENDING.md`](OPERATOR_ACTIONS_PENDING.md) 의 release section 으로 surface 된다. `upgrade --apply` 가 admin agent 한테 자동 등록한 `[upgrade-complete]` task 에서 reference 됨. troubleshooting + rollback + admin host source-checkout 변형은 `UPGRADING.md` 참조.

### Daily-backup tuning (v0.7.2+)

`agent-bridge upgrade --apply` 는 매 호출마다 `bridge-upgrade.py cleanup-residue` 를 자동 실행한다 (stale `*.tgz.tmp.*` 정리 + daily archive prune + `state/backup-snapshots/` SQL snapshot prune + `backups/upgrade-*/` 보수적 prune + `~/.claude.json` 검증). cleanup 결과는 upgrade JSON 출력과 `[upgrade-complete]` task body 의 "Backup residue cleanup" 섹션에 같이 실린다.

수동으로 동일 cleanup 실행:

```bash
TARGET_ROOT="$HOME/.agent-bridge"
python3 "$TARGET_ROOT/bridge-upgrade.py" cleanup-residue --target-root "$TARGET_ROOT"
```

Backup 동작 조정 환경변수 (모두 `agent-roster.local.sh` 또는 systemd unit env 에 export 가능):

| 변수 | 기본값 | 설명 |
|---|---|---|
| `BRIDGE_DAILY_BACKUP_ENABLED` | `1` | `0` 으로 daemon-side daily backup 자체를 비활성화. cleanup 자체는 upgrade 시 여전히 동작. |
| `BRIDGE_DAILY_BACKUP_HOUR` | `4` | 시도 시작 시각 (0–23). |
| `BRIDGE_DAILY_BACKUP_RETAIN_DAYS` | `7` | tarball + SQL snapshot 보관 일수. v0.7.2 에서 30 → 7 로 축소 (#507). |
| `BRIDGE_DAILY_BACKUP_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `3600` | 실패 후 다음 시도 억제 시간. cooldown window 당 `daemon_warn` + audit row 1회. |
| `BRIDGE_DAILY_BACKUP_TMP_GRACE_SECONDS` | `180` | `*.tgz.tmp.*` reaper 가 무시할 최소 나이 (= daemon timeout 120s + grace 60s). |
| `BRIDGE_DAILY_BACKUP_EXCLUDE_ROOTS` | (empty) | tar walk 추가 exclude (콜론 또는 콤마 구분 relpath). hardcoded 기본 제외: `logs/`, `worktrees/`, `runtime/{assets,media,extensions}/`, `.claude/worktrees/`, `state/backup-snapshots/`, plus any-depth `__pycache__` / `node_modules`. |
| `BRIDGE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_RETAIN_COUNT` | `5` | upgrade-* snapshot 최소 보존 개수 (현재 BACKUP_ROOT 는 항상 추가 보존). |
| `BRIDGE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_RETAIN_DAYS` | `14` | retain count 를 넘긴 upgrade-* 중 이 일수보다 오래된 것만 prune. |

Health check (post-upgrade):

```bash
TARGET_ROOT="$HOME/.agent-bridge"
agent-bridge status | head -20
cat "$TARGET_ROOT/state/daily-backup/state.env"   # last success / failure / cooldown
python3 "$TARGET_ROOT/bridge-upgrade.py" verify-tasks-db --target-root "$TARGET_ROOT"
du -sh "$TARGET_ROOT/backups/daily" "$TARGET_ROOT/backups"/upgrade-*
```

For a source checkout to live runtime deploy during development:

```bash
cd ~/.agent-bridge-source
./scripts/deploy-live-install.sh --dry-run --target ~/.agent-bridge
./scripts/deploy-live-install.sh --target ~/.agent-bridge --restart-daemon
```

### autoCompactWindow default (v0.7.6+, issue #570)

`bridge-hooks.py render-shared-settings` writes a managed
`autoCompactWindow` default of `1_000_000` for every managed Claude agent,
regardless of model variant. The previous `[1m]` launch_cmd substring
heuristic (issue #547) never fired in practice — `[1m]` is a model-id
suffix the runtime *prints* (`claude-opus-4-7[1m]`), not a CLI argument
the launcher passes — so agents always landed on the legacy `400_000`
cap and `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=45` compacted at ~180K instead
of the intended ~450K. The unconditional 1M setting is a no-regret upper
bound: any model with a smaller native context window will compact
earlier on its own.

Operator overlays (`~/.agent-bridge/.claude/settings.local.json` and
per-agent base `settings.json`) still win over the managed default.
Operators who want to cap a particular install at the legacy 400K
window can set:

```sh
export CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=400000
```

in `agent-roster.local.sh` (env wins over settings per Claude Code's
resolution order, so this overrides the managed default and survives
`agent-bridge upgrade --apply`).

**Per-agent settings.effective.json (issue #555).** As of v0.7.x+, every
managed agent has its own `settings.effective.json` rendered at
`$BRIDGE_AGENT_HOME_ROOT/<agent>/.claude/settings.effective.json` and the
agent's workdir `settings.json` symlinks to it. Per-agent values are
independent: each managed agent renders its own file, so per-agent base
or overlay overrides are no longer clobbered by whichever sibling ran
the last `agb upgrade --apply` / restart-rerender.

The shared base (`$BRIDGE_AGENT_HOME_ROOT/.claude/settings.json`) and
overlay (`settings.local.json`) remain install-wide and are still
authoritative for hook wiring and operator overrides; only the *effective*
output (managed defaults + base + overlay) is split per agent.

Existing installs migrate automatically on the next `agb upgrade --apply`:
the per-agent loop renders each agent's per-agent effective file and
re-points its workdir symlink. The old install-wide
`$BRIDGE_AGENT_HOME_ROOT/.claude/settings.effective.json` becomes
orphaned but harmless after migration (no symlink references it);
operators may delete it manually after verifying the per-agent files
exist and contain the expected `autoCompactWindow` value.

### promptSuggestionEnabled default (v0.7.x+, issue #630)

`bridge-hooks.py render-shared-settings` writes a managed
`promptSuggestionEnabled: false` default for every managed Claude
agent, alongside `autoCompactWindow`. This disables Claude Code's
inline composer ghost text — the dimmed "Try asking …" suggestion
that appears in the input box after a turn completes.

Why this is a managed default: the daemon's pending-input detector
(`bridge_tmux_session_inject_busy` →
`bridge_tmux_line_has_sgr_dim`, `lib/bridge-tmux.sh:1322`) reads the
ghost text as real typed input and defers the first send of every
queued task until the nudge fallback fires (~30s–1min latency). PR
\#566 added an SGR-2 (dim) detector to filter the dim form, but
newer Claude Code builds render the suggestion with other ANSI
shapes (24-bit gray, 256-color faint, `\x1b[90m`) the narrow
detector misses (#630). Disabling the feature at the settings layer
is the stable fix — bridge-managed agents are operated through the
queue, not by a human typing in the composer, so the suggestion has
no value here.

Operator opt-out (re-enable for an agent you attach to interactively):
add `"promptSuggestionEnabled": true` to the per-agent overlay
(`settings.local.json`) or to the install-wide overlay
(`$BRIDGE_AGENT_HOME_ROOT/.claude/settings.local.json`). Overlay wins
over managed defaults via the renderer's
`managed defaults < base < overlay < preserved user keys` order.

### PreCompact channel auto-notify (issue #597, in-flight)

Agent Bridge can post a one-line notice to the channel that most
recently messaged a static Claude agent when the agent enters auto
compaction, and a follow-up when compaction completes. The feature is
**default OFF** and lands in tracks: Track A (route primitive) and
Track D (Discord relay activity-index writer + smoke fixture) are
shipped; Track B (daemon observer + send primitive + EMA stats) and
Track C (Teams/Mattermost TS plugin writers) follow.

Operator surface, once all tracks land:

- Per-agent opt-in (in `agent-roster.local.sh`):
  `BRIDGE_AGENT_PRECOMPACT_NOTIFY["<agent>"]="1"`. The agent must be
  static, Claude-engine, channel-bound, and have received a recent user
  inbound (default 30 min) on at least one bound plugin channel.
- Global kill switch (no redeploy): `BRIDGE_PRECOMPACT_NOTIFY_DISABLED=1`
  in the daemon's environment, then restart or HUP the daemon.
- Recency window override:
  `BRIDGE_PRECOMPACT_NOTIFY_RECENCY_SECONDS=<seconds>` (default `1800`).
- Dry-run for CI / smoke verification:
  `BRIDGE_PRECOMPACT_NOTIFY_DRY_RUN=1` skips real network sends.

Activity index files live at
`$BRIDGE_STATE_DIR/channels/<plugin>/<agent>.json` and are populated by
the Discord wake relay (`bridge-discord-relay.py`) and, once Track C
ships, by the Teams and Mattermost MCP plugins. The route primitive
(`bridge-channels.py route-precompact-target`) is consumer-only and
returns exit 1 with empty stdout when no eligible recent inbound
exists, so a missing or empty index is a silent skip — never a hard
failure.

## Recommended Collaboration Pattern

1. Start agents
2. Create tasks through the queue
3. Let each agent claim work
4. Use urgent sends only for real interrupts

Typical operator flow:

```bash
agb --codex --name dev
agb --claude --name tester
agb task create --to tester --title "retest" --body-file ~/.agent-bridge/shared/report.md
agb inbox tester
agb claim 1 --agent tester
agb done 1 --agent tester --note "verified"
```

## Static Roles

Fresh installs have no static roles. This is intentional.

If you want machine-local static roles:

```bash
cp ~/.agent-bridge/agent-roster.local.example.sh ~/.agent-bridge/agent-roster.local.sh
```

Put machine-specific workdirs, channel IDs, tokens, and launch commands in
`agent-roster.local.sh`, not in tracked source.

Tracked prompt/profile templates live under `agents/`. Private production
prompt stacks should stay out of the public repository unless they are generic
enough for all users.

If the live CLI home differs from the bridge workdir, declare
`BRIDGE_AGENT_PROFILE_HOME["agent"]="..."` in `agent-roster.local.sh` and use:

```bash
agb profile status
agb profile diff <agent>
agb profile deploy <agent>
```

### Claude launch-flag overrides

For dynamic Claude agents (and static Claude agents that rely on the
bridge-built launch command), three optional roster fields control the
generated `claude` invocation:

| field | default when opted in | flag |
|---|---|---|
| `BRIDGE_AGENT_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-7` | `--model` |
| `BRIDGE_AGENT_EFFORT` | `xhigh` | `--effort` |
| `BRIDGE_AGENT_PERMISSION_MODE` | `auto` | `--permission-mode` |

Leaving all three unset preserves the historical
`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --name <agent>` shape byte-for-byte,
so rosters that predate these fields keep launching unchanged. Setting any
one field opts the agent into the new shape; remaining fields fall back to
the defaults above. Set `BRIDGE_AGENT_PERMISSION_MODE["agent"]="legacy"`
to explicitly pin the historical blanket-bypass shape (e.g. for sandboxed
offline roles).

### Admin agent CRUD policy

Admin operates exclusively through typed `agent <verb>` subcommands. Direct
edits to protected-roster files (`$BRIDGE_ROSTER_LOCAL_FILE`, by default
`~/.agent-bridge/agent-roster.local.sh`) are intentionally blocked because
the audit chain depends on the typed-write path. Any out-of-band edits will
be reverted by the daemon's reconciliation pass on next sync — bring
changes through `agent update` (or `agent-bridge config set` for global
settings) instead.

Typed verbs available today (run `agent-bridge agent --help` for the full
listing):

- `create` — scaffold a new static role (agent home + roster block).
- `update` — typed audited mutation of protected managed-role fields
  (`--desc`, `--engine`, `--workdir`, `--loop on|off`,
  `--continue on|off`, `--class user|system`, `--set-launch-cmd`,
  `--launch-cmd-add-env`/`--launch-cmd-remove-env`,
  `--launch-cmd-add-dev-channel`/`--launch-cmd-remove-dev-channel`,
  `--channels-set`/`--channels-add`/`--channels-remove`).
- `delete` — remove a static role (with optional `--purge-home` /
  `--purge-crons`).
- `retire` — retire a static role with quarantine + audit trail.
- `list` — inventory of registered agents.
- `registry` — read-only JSON inventory.
- `show` — roster + runtime state for one agent.
- `reclassify` — promote a runtime-detected admin to a static role.
- `rerender-settings` — re-render per-agent `settings.effective.json`.

Caller validation matches `config set`: caller must be the admin agent
(`BRIDGE_ADMIN_AGENT_ID`) and the source must be operator-trusted
(`operator-tui` / `operator-trusted-id`). Mutations that fail this gate
are denied with an audit row and never touch the roster file.

## Worktree Workers

When multiple agents may edit the same git repository, prefer isolated managed
worktrees:

```bash
agb --codex --name reviewer-a --prefer new
agb worktree list
```

Managed worktrees live under:

```text
~/.agent-bridge/worktrees/<repo-slug>/<agent>
```

## Status And Debugging

Use these first:

```bash
agb status
agb status --watch
agb summary
agb list
agb doctor [--json]                # surface stuck-state signals (read-only) for admin self-healing recipes (#511)
agb cron inventory --limit 20
agb cron inventory --mode one-shot --limit 20
agb cron list --agent <agent>
agb cron errors report --limit 20
agb cron cleanup report
```

`agb status` includes columns for source kind, loop mode, queue load, wake
status, activity age, and stale-session health. Stale health is based on local
tmux activity and recorded bridge state, not on model calls.

For tooling that needs the full agent enumeration plus provenance and
privilege-class together (cleanup detectors, retirement scripts,
third-party housekeeping helpers), use `agb agent registry --json`. It
returns one JSON record per agent id known on this host (static +
dynamic + system) with `class` (`system|dynamic|static` — system wins
over the static/dynamic split for cleanup callers), `agent_source`
(raw `static|dynamic`), `privilege_class` (raw `user|system`), `home`,
`workdir`, `engine`, `session`, `is_alive` (tmux session present), and
`source` (which loader path made the id known: `static-roster`,
`dynamic-active-env`, `dynamic-history-live-session`,
`dynamic-tmux-recovered`). Output is sorted by id for stable diffs.
This is the recommended endpoint for any cleanup tool that needs to
subtract the live dynamic-agent set before flagging directories as
orphan — `agb agent list` does not surface dynamic agents, which is
why naive cleanup rules historically false-positived live `--prefer
new` workers.

When changing cron behavior, inspect jobs before modifying them:

```bash
agb cron show <job-id>
agb cron sync --dry-run
```

One-shot jobs should be tested with dry-run first:

```bash
agb cron enqueue <job-id> --slot 2026-04-05 --dry-run
```

Automatic recurring scheduling is **on by default** — once the daemon is
running, every registered job is considered for enqueue on each sync tick.
To opt out (for example, on a machine that should not actively enqueue
recurring work), set the flag explicitly to `0`:

```bash
BRIDGE_CRON_SYNC_ENABLED=0
```

Legacy variables `BRIDGE_LEGACY_CRON_SYNC_ENABLED` and
`BRIDGE_OPENCLAW_CRON_SYNC_ENABLED` are still honored for backwards
compatibility; any of the three explicitly set to `0` disables automatic
enqueue.

A pre-flight memory guard (#263 Track B) probes host memory before spawning
the cron disposable child. On Darwin the probe rejects dispatch when swap
usage meets or exceeds `BRIDGE_CRON_SWAP_PCT_LIMIT` (default `80`). On Linux
it rejects when `MemAvailable` drops below `BRIDGE_CRON_MIN_AVAIL_MB`
megabytes (default `512`). A deferred run writes `state=deferred` to the run's
`status.json`, emits a `cron_dispatch_deferred` audit row, and pings the
admin agent; the next scheduler tick re-fires the slot.

Inspect runtime state directly when needed:

```bash
cat ~/.agent-bridge/state/active-roster.md
sqlite3 ~/.agent-bridge/state/tasks.db '.tables'
tail -n 80 ~/.agent-bridge/state/daemon.log
tail -n 80 ~/.agent-bridge/logs/bridge-$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

## Safe Cleanup

Kill active bridge sessions:

```bash
agb kill all
```

Stop the daemon:

```bash
agb daemon stop
```

**Active-agent guard** (issues #314 / #315): `bridge-daemon.sh stop` refuses
to stop the daemon when active bridge agents are running on the host, and
prints a banner pointing at the sanctioned upgrade entrypoint. To stop the
daemon during a recovery scenario, pass `--force`:

```bash
bash ~/.agent-bridge/bridge-daemon.sh stop --force
```

For a routine upgrade, prefer `agent-bridge upgrade --apply` — it handles
daemon stop + restart + agent re-launch internally and does not need
`--force`.

Remove only runtime artifacts if you need a clean local reset:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.agent-bridge/state ~/.agent-bridge/logs
mkdir -p ~/.agent-bridge/state ~/.agent-bridge/logs ~/.agent-bridge/shared
```

Do not delete `agent-roster.local.sh` unless you intentionally want to remove
local static roles.

### Test-artifact name policy (issue #598 Track 4)

Agent names matching test-artifact patterns are refused at create time and
on dynamic spawn unless the operator explicitly opts in with
`--test-fixture`. The blocked patterns are:

- prefix `smoke-`
- prefix `test-`
- prefix `bootstrap-`
- prefix `created-agent-`
- prefix `pref-`
- suffix `-repro-<N>` (digits)

```bash
# refused (no flag, looks like a leftover smoke fixture)
agent-bridge agent create smoke-foo

# accepted (explicit opt-in; cleanup tooling may reap this agent)
agent-bridge agent create smoke-foo --test-fixture

# same policy on dynamic spawn
agent-bridge --codex --name smoke-x --test-fixture
```

When `--test-fixture` is used, an `agent_test_fixture_created` audit row
records the opt-in so cleanup tooling can identify which agents were
created intentionally as test fixtures. Existing agents already in the
roster are grandfathered — the policy only fires at the create / new-spawn
entry point.

## Platform Scope

Agent Bridge runs on both macOS and Linux, but the two hosts have
different support targets for multi-tenant isolation:

- **macOS** is a developer and single-operator target. Static agents
  run in `shared` mode (the default); per-UID isolation is not
  implemented. Hardening is limited to the hook layer (tool policy,
  prompt guard) and operator vigilance.
- **Linux** is the production target for multi-principal deployments.
  `BRIDGE_AGENT_ISOLATION_MODE=linux-user` enforces per-agent UID
  separation and is required when agents hold delegated credentials or
  handle untrusted external input. See issues
  [#68](https://github.com/SYRS-AI/agent-bridge-public/issues/68) and
  [#85](https://github.com/SYRS-AI/agent-bridge-public/issues/85).

On macOS the `linux-user` mode falls back to shared silently (see
`bridge_agent_linux_user_isolation_effective` in
[`lib/bridge-agents.sh`](./lib/bridge-agents.sh)), and the migration
helper `agent-bridge isolate <agent>` (#85) exits with an explanatory
error. Full matrix and rationale in
[docs/platform-support.md](./docs/platform-support.md).

For the step-by-step operator walkthrough for transitioning an existing
Linux fleet from shared mode to per-UID isolation one agent at a time,
see [docs/isolation-migration-guide.md](./docs/isolation-migration-guide.md).

Isolated agents reach peer agents through the queue gateway, not the
SQLite DB directly. The per-agent scoped env file
(`<state>/agents/<agent>/agent-env.sh`) carries every static peer's id and
non-secret metadata (description, engine, session, workdir, isolation
mode, prompt-guard policy) so client-side validation
(`bridge_require_agent`, prompt-guard) passes for any registered peer.
Peer `BRIDGE_AGENT_LAUNCH_CMD` is **never** emitted into the scoped env —
the array entry is present-but-empty so callers fall through to the
controller-side path. Direct sqlite access from the isolated UID stays
blocked by the `BRIDGE_TASK_DB` ACL strip; gateway routing is selected
explicitly via the `BRIDGE_GATEWAY_PROXY=1` flag the scoped env writer
emits when `BRIDGE_AGENT_ISOLATION_MODE=linux-user`. See issue
[#294](https://github.com/SYRS-AI/agent-bridge-public/issues/294).

> **Upgrading from <0.6.13:** the gateway-proxy gate now requires
> `BRIDGE_GATEWAY_PROXY=1` in the scoped env. Restart isolated agents

> <agent> --no-attach`) so the env file is rewritten with the new flag.

### Picking up the curated `bin/` after upgrade

After v0.7.6+, isolated agents can call `agb` bare from their Bash tool
because the launcher prepends `${BRIDGE_HOME}/bin` to the agent's PATH
and the curated `bin/agb` shim auto-sources `BRIDGE_AGENT_ENV_FILE`
before delegating to the underlying `${BRIDGE_HOME}/agb`. Existing
isolated agents pick this up by re-running:

```bash
agent-bridge isolate <agent> --reapply
```

(idempotent; only re-installs the ACL contract, doesn't mutate
ownership) followed by an agent restart so `bridge-start.sh`
regenerates the agent's `agent-env.sh` with the new PATH.

### Isolated `agb` subcommand allowlist + audit

When `bin/agb` is invoked from an isolated UID context (env carries
`BRIDGE_GATEWAY_PROXY=1` AND the running UID differs from
`BRIDGE_CONTROLLER_UID`, both emitted by
`bridge_write_linux_agent_env_file`), the shim enforces a curated
allowlist:

- Allowed: `inbox`, `show`, `claim`, `done`, `summary`, `create`.
- Anything else (including `admin`, `upgrade`, `daemon`, `urgent`,
  `kill`, `attach`, `agent start|stop|restart|create|update`,
  `cron *`, `config set`, `setup`, `isolate`, `unisolate`, `worktree`,
  `audit`, `wave dispatch`) returns exit `64` with a clean message
  pointing the operator at the queue route
  (`agb create --to admin --title "..."`).

Every isolated invocation (allow or deny) appends a JSONL row to
`${BRIDGE_HOME}/logs/agents/<agent>/audit.jsonl` carrying
`{ts, agent, uid, subcommand, arg_count, decision, reason}`. Argument
**values** are intentionally not captured — task IDs and note text may
be sensitive — so audit reviewers see the call shape, not the
operator's text. Operators who need to invoke administrative
subcommands run `agb` from the controller shell, not from inside an
isolated agent's tmux pane. Existing isolated agents pick up the
controller-UID env-file emission by re-running the same
`agent-bridge isolate <agent> --reapply` + restart sequence from the
PR1 section above.

### Bridge-native skills under the isolated HOME

Bridge-native Claude skills (`agent-bridge-runtime`, `cron-manager`,
`memory-wiki`, `patch-permission-approval`) are synced into
`<isolated-home>/.claude/skills/<skill>/` on agent isolate, restart,
`agent-bridge isolate <agent> --reapply`, and `agb upgrade`. Claude Code
running under the isolated UID reads `~/.claude/skills/` from that home,
so the workdir-side symlinks used by shared agents are not visible
there — the bridge installs a parallel rendered copy into the isolated
home instead. Skill body text is normalized at sync time so every
`~/.agent-bridge/agb` and `~/.agent-bridge/agent-bridge` reference
becomes the absolute `${BRIDGE_HOME}/agb` (resp. `${BRIDGE_HOME}/agent-bridge`)
path. This decouples skill commands from `~` resolution under the
isolated UID and from the per-home `~/.agent-bridge` symlink, so they
work even on installs where that symlink is missing or the operator-home
parent path differs from `BRIDGE_HOME`.

### Bridge hooks under the isolated HOME (settings.json rendering)

Claude Code under the isolated UID reads `~/.claude/settings.json` from
the isolated UID's HOME, not from the workdir — so the workdir-side
shared-settings symlink installed for non-isolated agents is invisible
there. The bridge installs hook entries (Stop, UserPromptSubmit,
SessionStart, PermissionDenied, PreToolUse/PostToolUse) into the
isolated HOME by rendering a controller-owned
`<isolated-home>/.claude/settings.effective.json` and pointing
`<isolated-home>/.claude/settings.json` at it via a symlink.

Integrity contract: the effective file is owned by `root:root` mode
`0644`; the symlink is owned by the isolated UID but the underlying
target is not. The isolated UID can read the hook contract but cannot
mutate it from inside its own session. Pre-existing user keys
(`enabledPlugins`, `extraKnownMarketplaces`,
`skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt`) from any prior regular
`settings.json` are preserved across the transition.

The render runs on agent isolate, restart,
`agent-bridge isolate <agent> --reapply`, and `agb agent
rerender-settings --apply`. Operators on existing installs pick up the
synced skills and hook entries by re-running:

```bash
agent-bridge isolate <agent> --reapply
```

then restarting the agent so the next session loads the synced skills
and reads the rendered settings.

## Migrating to layout v2

The v2 layout (PR-A/B/C, shipped in v0.6.19) replaces named-ACL access on
per-agent runtime data with group-based ownership under a single
`$BRIDGE_DATA_ROOT`. PR-D adds the operator tool to migrate an existing
legacy install onto v2.

Activation criteria: marker file at `$BRIDGE_HOME/state/layout-marker.sh`
present, owner root or controller, mode 0640, content limited to an
allowlist of `BRIDGE_LAYOUT=v2` / `BRIDGE_DATA_ROOT=<absolute path>` / a
small set of group overrides. Anything else is rejected at load time and
the install falls back to legacy.

**Phases** (run from an out-of-band controller shell, NOT from inside an
Agent Bridge agent session — the migration tool's self-stop guard refuses
otherwise):

1. **dry-run** — print the legacy → v2 mirror plan and the
   profile_home preflight. No mutation. Use `--data-root` to choose the
   target (e.g. `/srv/agent-bridge`).

   ```bash
   agent-bridge migrate isolation-v2 dry-run --data-root /srv/agent-bridge
   ```

2. **apply** — stop active agents one by one, stop the daemon
   (active=0 path, no `--force`), ensure the v2 groups exist (sudo),
   real-copy mirror legacy → v2 (rsync, no hardlinks), write the marker
   atomically, restart daemon and the agents from the snapshot, post-flight
   probe each agent UID's groups via fresh `sudo -u <user> id -nG`.

   ```bash
   agent-bridge migrate isolation-v2 apply --data-root /srv/agent-bridge --yes
   ```

   Apply refuses if any agent's roster has an explicit
   `BRIDGE_AGENT_PROFILE_HOME` that is not `<data_root>/agents/<agent>/workdir`.
   Edit `agent-roster.local.sh` (via `agent-bridge config set`) to align
   the override and re-run, or unset it and re-run.

3. **soak** — operate on v2 for as long as you want to be sure things
   work. Rollback is cheap (legacy tree is intact until commit).

   ```bash
   agent-bridge migrate isolation-v2 status
   agent-bridge migrate isolation-v2 rollback --yes   # if needed
   ```

4. **commit** — tar-zst backup + delete the legacy paths recorded in the
   manifest as `verify_status=ok && delete_eligible=1`. Profile/skill/memory
   files (delete_eligible=0, see below) are NOT deleted.

   ```bash
   agent-bridge migrate isolation-v2 commit --yes
   ```

### Rollback hatch — `BRIDGE_DISABLE_ISOLATION=1`

If v2 isolation hits an unforeseen issue post-deploy, set
`BRIDGE_DISABLE_ISOLATION=1` in the controller environment (the daemon
unit, the operator's shell, or both — anywhere the bridge entry points
read the env), and restart the daemon plus any affected agents.

What it does:

- Skips the v2 secret-env exec wrap and the `umask 007` wrap in
  `bridge-run.sh`. The agent runs under the controller UID with the
  default 0077 umask.
- Skips the v2 group/sudo prep in `bridge-start.sh`. SUDO_WRAP stays
  inactive, no per-agent `agent-env.sh` is written, no Claude
  credential repair is attempted.
- Surfaces `isolation: disabled-by-env` in `agent-bridge agent show
  <agent>` and replaces the iso column in `agent-bridge agent list`
  with `disabled-by-env`. The configured `isolation_mode` is left in
  place so the JSON form still carries both fields.

What it does NOT do:

- Does NOT re-enable v1 ACL helpers — they are deleted in v0.8.0.
- Does NOT mutate the layout marker or any per-agent `isolation_mode`.
  v2 resumes the moment the env is unset and the daemon + agents
  restart.
- Does NOT call `agent-bridge migrate isolation-v2 commit`. Legacy
  paths (if any remain) are preserved.

This is a debugging escape, not a permanent operating mode. Operators
who set this should report the underlying issue upstream so v2 can be
fixed; long-term operation without isolation is unsupported in v0.8.0.

```bash
# Set in the daemon environment, then restart.
BRIDGE_DISABLE_ISOLATION=1 ./agent-bridge daemon restart
```

### Editing profile / skills / memory after activation

After v2 activation, runtime resolvers (`bridge-skills.sh`,
`bridge-setup.sh`, `bridge-agent.sh`, `bridge-upgrade.sh`,
`bootstrap-memory-system.sh`, the wiki cron suite) read from the v2
workdir (`$BRIDGE_DATA_ROOT/agents/<agent>/workdir/`). PR-D additionally
fixes `bridge_agent_default_profile_home` so that `agent-bridge profile
deploy` writes to the v2 workdir as well — closing a gap left by PR-A/B/C
where the profile alias still pointed at v2 `home/`.

These files are mirrored to the v2 workdir with `delete_eligible=0`,
meaning the install-root copy is **retained as a frozen snapshot** through
`--commit`:

- `agents/<agent>/CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `SOUL.md`,
  `HEARTBEAT.md`, `MEMORY-SCHEMA.md`, `COMMON-INSTRUCTIONS.md`,
  `CHANGE-POLICY.md`, `TOOLS.md`
- `agents/<agent>/SESSION-TYPE.md`, `NEXT-SESSION.md` (dual-read)
- `agents/<agent>/.agents/`, `memory/`, `users/`, `references/`, `skills/`

**Edit at the v2 workdir.** The runtime resolver reads the v2 path first;
the install-root copy is left in place so existing admin tooling and a
clean rollback remain possible. A future PR (PR-G) is expected to either
unify the two locations or mark the install-root copy read-only.

### v2 ACL contract (PR-E)

PR-E removes named-user POSIX ACLs from v2 mode in favor of POSIX group
ownership + setgid. Scope and exceptions:

- **Scope.** When `bridge_isolation_v2_active`, every named-user ACL
  primitive (`bridge_linux_acl_add`, `bridge_linux_acl_add_recursive`,
  `bridge_linux_acl_add_default_dirs_recursive`,
  `bridge_linux_acl_remove_recursive`) and the v2-noopable wrappers
  (`bridge_linux_grant_traverse_chain`,
  `bridge_linux_revoke_traverse_chain`,
  `bridge_linux_revoke_plugin_channel_grants`,
  `bridge_linux_acl_repair_channel_env_files`) short-circuit to a
  no-op. Their replacements in v2 are group ownership + setgid:
  - **agent-env.sh**: chgrp `ab-agent-<name>`, chmod 0640
    (controller owner; isolated UID reads via group bit).
  - **per-UID `installed_plugins.json`**: chgrp `ab-agent-<name>`,
    chmod 0640 (root owner; isolated UID reads via group bit).
  - **`$user_home/.claude/plugins`** + `marketplaces`: chown
    `root:ab-agent-<name>`, chmod 2750 (setgid; new children inherit
    `ab-agent-<name>`).
  - **channel symlink target dir**: chown `<isolated_user>`, chgrp
    `ab-agent-<name>`, chmod 2770 (setgid; new files inside inherit
    group + group rw).
  - **bridge-run.sh launches**: `umask 007` is applied via
    `bridge_run_apply_v2_umask_if_needed` after `bridge_require_agent`,
    so files created by the agent process tree land at 0660 with
    correct group ownership.

- **Transitional exception (Claude credentials).** The v2 layout does
  not include the operator's `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, so
  `bridge_linux_grant_claude_credentials_access` retains named-user
  ACL access in v2 mode for that single file plus the traversal chain
  up to the operator's home. This is the **only** v2 surface that uses
  ACLs. PR-F or a future PR is expected to replace this with per-agent
  `claude login` (operator workflow change). The helper itself fails
  loud (`bridge_die`) when `setfacl` is unavailable, so silent breakage
  is impossible.

- **Engine CLI prerequisite (v2).** v2 mode requires the engine CLI to
  resolve to a base-readable path (`other::r-x` along the entire
  ancestor chain). `bridge_linux_grant_engine_cli_access` validates
  both `cli_path` and its `readlink -f` target; controller-home paths
  are rejected with `bridge_die`. Install Claude/Codex in
  `/usr/local/bin` (or another path with no controller-home ancestor)
  before activating v2.

- **`acl` package.** v2 + non-Claude engines do not require the `acl`
  package. v2 + Claude does, because the credential exception above
  uses `setfacl`. `bridge_linux_prepare_agent_isolation` gates
  `bridge_linux_require_setfacl` accordingly.

- **`BRIDGE_SHARED_GROUP` membership.** v2 prep ensures the isolated
  UID is a member of `ab-shared` (default) so it can read the shared
  plugin cache. Controller failure to update its own membership is a
  warn unless the controller can no longer read
  `bridge_isolation_v2_shared_plugins_root`, in which case it
  escalates to die (the operator must re-login after the manual
  `usermod` for new group membership to take effect).

### PR-E smoke (operator-runnable)

```bash
# Always-on rootless cases (17, run on every PR review).
tests/isolation-v2-pr-e/smoke.sh

# Opt-in root-required cases (4, run against a live install with at
# least two ab-agent groups). Requires sudo -n -u <isolated-user>.
BRIDGE_TEST_V2_PRE_ROOT=1 tests/isolation-v2-pr-e/smoke.sh
```

The opt-in cases verify kernel-level cross-agent EACCES, self-agent
read access, engine CLI exec via the isolated UID, and the
`setgid + umask 007` composition for files created inside a v2
channel target dir. These cannot be substituted by rootless
fake-group assertions.
